The project currently contains two parts that run on different servers, the front-end `http://localhost:3000` and the back-end `http://localhost:3012`, so the front end sends requests to the server by the fetch method.

1. cd to the backend folder and write`npm install` in the terminal .
2. cd to the frontend folder and write run the command `npm install`.
3. in the frontend folder run `npm start` which will run the app in your default browser.
